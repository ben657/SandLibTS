This is a basic (at the moment) JavaScript library for making games. It uses the HTML5 canvas element for all rendering.
At the moment, the general structure is similar to that of Flahspunk (an AS3 game library) in which you create various "scenes" which will contain all the logic and elements for whatever your game is going to do. These for myself are generally menus or levels within the game.
